# PHP-task-for-Orchidia-software
This repository is to finish a task that Orchidia software asked me for. <br />
The task has been done using PHP and connected to an Excel sheet as a Database file. <br />
The task is a simulation of Google forms, the user enters the data and we get it in the backend in a spicific sheet. <br />
